# CEN-SE
Project CEN 3
Topic : Bussines Management System.
* Business Management Systems (BMS) are great in theory.  They offer you the tools and strategies to document your business processes and define the way you work.  They are a standard method to achieve consistency and quality in everything you do.
* After all, a Business Management System is only valuable if it is easy to use, helpful and recognisable as ‘the way your company does things’.
* The aim of a BMS should be to place your business processes front and centre in the mind of your workforce. 
It should be the Quality System that ensures everyone in your company sees how you do things and why. 

Our purpose is to build a software who keeps track of this particular business's activity.
The problems that this management system will solve are: 
* The management of employees in a more accurate and easy way.
* The management of the warehouse and inventory by the service staff. 
* The possibility of managing all the systems of the factory by the managers. 
* A user-friendly app that allows anyone to communicate and use it without difficulties.

The purpose of our application is to facilitate the way a business works in Albania. Although we 
are in 2022, many records are being stored manually on paper, which makes the data unsafe, 
and very difficult to process. There is a lot actual functional digital management system to help 
them manage the staff updates, bills and inventory but not all of them can specifically perform 
some tasks which are really important for that kind of company. Since they cannot use 2-3 
apps for performing different tasks because it is really confusing and requires a lot of time and 
effort, we built that app to make everything easier
The system will be running 24/7 since the material should be accessable for the employees 
and the admin at any time.
